# Linear motion detection by accelerometer

This was my 3rd year dissertation at Exeter University. I worked closely with my supervisor and ended up with a novel method of
linear motion detection with only the accelerometer on my phone (no gyroscope!) and two dumbbells.

Tech used: **Python · Numpy · Pandas · Jupyter**
