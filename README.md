# Linear motion detection by accelerometer

This was my 3rd year dissertation at Exeter University. I worked closely with my supervisor and ended up with a novel method of
linear motion detection with only the accelerometer on my phone (no gyroscope!) and two dumbbells.

Tech used: **Python · Numpy · Pandas · Jupyter**

# Installing it yourself

## Linux (Debian-based)

To run any of the notebooks yourself, follow the process detailed below.

```bash
$ python3 -m venv .venv

$ source .venv/bin/activate

$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

$ jupyter notebook
```
